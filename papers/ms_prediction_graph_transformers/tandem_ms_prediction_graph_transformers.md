Fig. 1 provides an overview of the method used in the study. It illustrates the process of extracting node and edge embeddings from the molecular graph, applying a graph transformer, extracting the chemical embedding from the readout node, adding spectral metadata, and predicting the binned spectrum. The input embeddings and graph transformer layers' parameters are initialized from a pretrained model and then fine-tuned on the spectrum prediction task. The figure visually represents the flow of information and processing steps involved in the model's operation.
