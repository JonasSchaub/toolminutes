# lwreg: A Lightweight System for Chemical Registration and Data Storage [@landrum_lwreg_2024]
![Graphical Abstract, source: [@landrum_lwreg_2024] CC-BY 4.0](lwreg_2024_images/graphical_abstract.jpeg){width="300" fig-align="center"}
## Why did I choose this paper?
- I have been interested in structure registration/standardisation systems for quite a while now
- In the open source realm, there are not many systems you can use, primarily the ChEMBL curation pipeline [@bento_open_2020]
- We had an early encounter with lwreg at [IWOMI 2023](https://www.iwomi.net/?page_id=42) (which is also acknowledged in the paper)
